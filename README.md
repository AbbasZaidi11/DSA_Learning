# Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to Striver's A2Z DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Sheet, a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering DSA concepts and problem-solving. I have implemented the solutions in C++ and included notes on important concepts, data structures, and algorithms to help solidify my understanding of DSA.

# Progress Overview
Here's an overview of my progress through the DSA sheet:

Step 1: Learn the basics
Step 2: Learn Important Sorting Techniques
Step 3: Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy -> Medium -> Hard]
Step 4: Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]
Step 5: Strings [Basic and Medium]
Step 6: Learn LinkedList [Single LL, Double LL, Medium, Hard Problems]
Step 7: Recursion [PatternWise]
Step 8: Bit Manipulation [Concepts & Problems]
Step 9: Stack and Queues [Learning, Pre-In-Post-fix, Monotonic Stack, Implementation]
Step 10: Sliding Window & Two Pointer Combined Problems
Step 11: Heaps [Learning, Medium, Hard Problems]
Step 12: Greedy Algorithms [Easy, Medium/Hard]
Step 13: Binary Trees [Traversals, Medium and Hard Problems]
Step 14: Binary Search Trees [Concept and Problems]
Step 15: Graphs [Concepts & Problems]
Step 16: Dynamic Programming [Patterns and Problems]
Step 17: Tries
Step 18: Strings
